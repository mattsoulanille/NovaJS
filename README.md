NovaJS
======

This is an experiment in making Escape Velocity Nova run in the browser. Escape Velocity Nova (EV Nova) is a game created by [Ambrosia Software](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/) in collaboration with [ATMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATMOS_Software).

[Here's a running example that supports multiplayer](http://54.173.49.38/) (works in modern browsers). This version is running release [0.1-alpha-js](https://github.com/mattsoulanille/NovaJS/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha-js), an earlier version written in JavaScript. The main branch's version is undergoing a rewrite / redesign, and is not at feature parity with the JS version yet.
#### Controls (mostly standard EV Nova):
* Arrow keys to move
* Spacebar to fire
* **There is a button on the right side of the screen to add enemy ships.**
* L while moving slowly over a planet to land
* Tab to select a target
* W to choose a secondary weapon
* **Left Shift to fire secondary weapon** (not Ctrl since that's used by Windows)
* R to choose nearest target
* Hold A to point towards target.
* Z for afterburner (if installed)
* **Scroll down in the outfitter and shipyard with the arrow keys to see more items**

### Project Goals
* Function as a Nova Engine that can, given Nova files, run EV Nova.
* Support Nova Plug-ins.
* Improve on some of the issues with EV Nova's engine (such as limited turning angles) as long as doing so does not negatively affect gameplay.
* **Support multiplayer to an extent.**

## Wait, but isn't EV Nova Copyrighted?

Yes. Escape Velocity Nova is copyrighted by Ambrosia Software. I claim no rights to anything in the [objects](https://github.com/mattsoulanille/NovaJS/tree/master/Nova/objects) directory. The end goal of this project is to write a Nova engine that can interpret Nova files without including any Nova data itself.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/),
[A Mac copy of EV Nova](https://www.reddit.com/r/evnova/comments/cwwjnf/ambrosia_software_mediafire_archive_mirror/) ([Direct Link](http://www.tuxedojack.com/hosted/ambrosia-archive/mac/Action-Adventure/EVNova%201.1.1.dmg))

### Installing
#### For the main branch
The main branch does not display anything yet, but it can be runn with `yarn start` and will launch on port 8443.

#### For the [alpha js relase](https://github.com/mattsoulanille/NovaJS/releases):

Download the release with your browser or with the following command
```
curl -L https://github.com/mattsoulanille/NovaJS/archive/v0.1-alpha-js.tar.gz | tar xzf -
```

Move your Nova Files and Plug-ins to the ```Nova Data``` directory in the unzipped release.
###### Make sure you're using the Mac version of EV Nova. Windows EV Nova file formats are currently unsupported, so make sure your Nova files end with `.ndat`
```
cd NovaJS-0.1-alpha-js/
cp -r /path/to/EV\ Nova.app/Contents/Resources/Nova\ Files/ ./Nova\ Data/
mkdir ./Nova\ Data/Plug-ins/
```
###### You can add any plug-ins you like in the Plug-ins directory. Just make sure they're in the Mac format or the Nova Data `.ndat` format if you're using Windows / Linux.

Install packages with `npm`
```
npm install
```
Build for release with 
```
npm run build
```
Alternatively, build for development and debugging with
```
npm run build-debug
```
At this point, you can run NovaJS with
```
npm run run
```
You can also use
```
npm run watch
```
to compile incremental changed made to the browser's code, but you will still need to do a full `npm run build-server` and restart the server for changes to be applied to the server.

By default the JS release runs on port 8000 but can be changed by editing the `port` variable in `settings/server.json`. Assuming you installed on the machine you would like to play from, navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Running the Tests
The available tests can be run with `yarn test`.

## Deployment
Deployment for the js release is the same as installation, however, the port used for the server can be changed by editing the `port` variable in `settings/server.json`. The main branch does not support deployment yet.

## Contributing

TBD once the rewrite has feature parity with the js version.


## Known Bugs
* Ship velocity scaling is wrong in that ships are far too fast. I think the scale should be 3/10 of what it currently is, but Nova gives a speed boost to the player when they're not playing in strict mode, so I don't know what the actual scale is. Perhaps the coordinate system needs to be redone so that no scaling is needed for non-player ships?
* Beam weapons do not clip after colliding with a target and instead pass through as if they did not collide (more of a feature that hasn't been implemented yet).
* Beam weapons seem to do too much damage.

## Unsolved Multiplayer Questions
* How will mission strings that significantly change the universe work?
  * Put people in their respective system for every changed system? But then it's not multiplayer.
      * What if you had a limited number of people per 'universe.' Then you could lock each mission or mission set by a particular player, essentially locking out anyone else from being able to affect that particular story-change. That way your changes have consequences and you can still have multiple people make changes that affect the galaxy outcome.
  * Put everyone in the same system, but make the planets different based on the state of the universe? But there are fleets...
      * What if you simply loaded a small set of systems based on a max cap of 5-10 players? Then you don't have to control the whole universe at once, but you can still have multiple fleets in a single system.  
  * Choose a system randomly and put everyone in it?
    * How do you detect which systems are actually just different amount instances of the same system?
          * Personally I think playing with friends is much more do-able than allowing 15+ people into your game session
  * This is probably the biggest proplem with multiplayer support, and I welcome any suggestions.
          * I think limiting the # of people makes the complexity much more do-able. :) 
* How will dates work? Realtime is definitely a bad idea for timing missions since it takes time to read the dialogue. Maybe everyone just has a different date that changes normally (when you jump / land)?
      * I actually think this is a really good idea. Maybe you could allow timing to be indiviual until everyone has no active quests, then update everyone to the player with the latest stardate (thematically other players just 'took a vacation.'
* Will there be some form of chat, and if so, where will it be? Perhaps you need to hail other ships to talk to them? Perhaps it's just in the bottom left info area?
      * Good idea! I would say everyone in the system with the ability to add friends or group-chats based on players whose vehicles you've hailed or maybe even a group feature before you go into the game.
* How will hailing other ships be managed when the game can't just pause at any time?
      * What would break by making a hail a textbox in real-time? It will add tension in spacefights but maybe that's okay?
* How will 2x speed work on a client basis? (It probably just won't and will be a server-configured option).
      * I think that would have to be a server-side option, perhaps it's something you can turn on if you find yourself in a system by yourself, otherwise it is locked to 1x to allow space-battles.
* How should pilot files be saved? How should deaths be handled?
      * Any reason not to have this client-side? Couldn't deaths be the same as they are in the original game?
